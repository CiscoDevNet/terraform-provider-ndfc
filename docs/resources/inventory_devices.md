# ndfc_inventory_devices (Resource)

Inventory is the resource to Add/Remove and configure switches in a fabric

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ndfc_inventory_devices" "test_resource_inventory_devices_1" {
  fabric_name                               = "CML"
  auth_protocol                             = "md5"
  username                                  = "admin"
  password                                  = "admin_password"
  max_hops                                  = 0
  set_as_individual_device_write_credential = false
  preserve_config                           = false
  save                                      = true
  deploy                                    = true
  retries                                   = 300
  retry_wait_timeout                        = 20
  devices = {
    "10.1.1.1" = {
      role                    = "spine"
      discovery_type          = "discover"
      discovery_auth_protocol = "md5"
    }
  }

}

## Schema

### Required

- `devices` (Attributes Map) The devices to manage in the inventory (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `fabric_name` (String) The name of the fabric
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password to use for the devices
- `username` (String) The username to use for the devices

### Optional

- `auth_protocol` (String) The authentication protocol to use for the devices
- `deploy` (Boolean) Default set to true. NDFC recommends deploying the configuration of the devices in inventory itself. Not doing so could lead to "out-of-sync" issues when configuring other resources during deployment in other resources.
- `max_hops` (Number) The maximum number of hops to use during the discovery of devices
- `preserve_config` (Boolean) Preserve the configuration of the devices
- `retries` (Number) The number of retries to use validate fabric status before execution of requests
- `retry_wait_timeout` (Number) The time to wait between retries to validate fabric status before execution of requests
- `save` (Boolean) Default set to true. NDFC recommends saving the configuration of the devices in inventory itself. Not doing so could lead to "out-of-sync" issues when configuring other resources during deployment in other resources.
- `seed_ip` (String) The seed IP address to use for the discovery devices
- `set_as_individual_device_write_credential` (Boolean) Set and use discovery credentials for LAN devices

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Terraform Unique Identifier for the Inventory Devices resource

<a id="nestedatt--devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `devices`

Optional:

- `breakout` (String) The breakout command provided to teh device
- `discovery_auth_protocol` (String) The discovery authentication protocol to use for the device
- `discovery_password` (String, Sensitive) The discovery password to use for the device
- `discovery_type` (String) The discovery type of the device
- `discovery_username` (String) The discovery username to use for the device
- `gateway` (String) The gateway to use for the device
- `hostname` (String) The hostname of the device
- `image_policy` (String) The image policy to use for the device
- `model` (String) The model of the device
- `modules_model` (Set of String) The switch modules model information.
- `port_mode` (String) The port mode of the breakout interface
- `role` (String) The role of the device
- `serial_number` (String) The serial number of the device
- `version` (String) The software version of the device

Read-Only:

- `config_status` (String) The configuration status of the device
- `device_index` (String) The NDFC device index
- `discovery_status` (String) The operational status of the device
- `managable` (Boolean) The managable status of the device
- `mode` (String) The mode of the device
- `oper_status` (String) The operational status of the device
- `switch_db_id` (String) The NDFC switch DB ID of the device
- `uuid` (String) The NDFC UUID of the device
- `vdc_id` (String) The VDC ID of the device
- `vdc_mac` (String) The VDC MAC of the device

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Format of ID used for import:
terraform import ndfc_inventory_devices.test_resource_inventory_devices fabric_cml
