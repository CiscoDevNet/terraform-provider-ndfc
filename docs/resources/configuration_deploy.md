Terraform plan will always show in-place update for this field when set to true.
- `fabric_name` (String) The name of the fabric

### Optional

- `config_save` (Boolean) Save the configuration
- `serial_numbers` (Set of String) Value 'ALL' if all switches in the fabric are to be deployed, or a list of serial numbers of the switches to be deployed

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Terraform Unique Identifier for the Inventory Devices resource
